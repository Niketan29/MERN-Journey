## ✅ What I learned today (5 points)
1. I understood how to use map/filter/reduce properly.
2. I learned how to group data using reduce.
3. I learned sorting without mutating original array using spread.
4. I practiced frequency counting using object keys.
5. I learned nested object access using split(".") path.

## ❌ Top 3 mistakes / confusion I faced
1. I was mutating the original array by using sort directly.
2. I forgot to return inside reduce callback.
3. I got confused between shallow copy and deep clone.

## 🔧 What I will improve tomorrow
- Write cleaner functions with proper naming
- Practice reduce more
- Avoid array/object mutation
