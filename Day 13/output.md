## What is MongoDB? 
MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-based database used to store data in JSON-like format.  
It is schema-less and allows flexible data structures compared to relational databases.  
MongoDB is widely used for scalable and high-performance backend applications.

## What is Mongoose? 
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js.  
It provides schemas, models, validation, and easy interaction with MongoDB.

## Difference between Schema and Model 
Schema defines the structure, fields, and rules of a document.  
Model is created using a schema and represents a collection in MongoDB.  
Schema is a blueprint, while Model is used to create and query documents.

## What you built today 
I connected a Node.js backend to MongoDB using Mongoose.  
I created a User schema and model and implemented DB-based controllers.  
I tested creating and fetching users and verified data in MongoDB Compass.
