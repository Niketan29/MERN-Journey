# Day 6 Report — React JSX, Props & Mapping

## ✅ What is JSX (2 lines)
JSX is a syntax extension in React that lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
React converts JSX into JavaScript code (React elements) that the browser can render.

## ✅ What are props (2 lines)
Props are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component in React.
They help us send data (like name, image, role) and make components reusable.

## ✅ Why we use map() in React (2 lines)
We use `map()` to loop through an array and render UI elements/components dynamically.
It helps display multiple cards/lists without writing repeated code manually.

## ✅ What you built today (3 lines)
Built a User Card component in React to display user details like image, name, role, and skills.
Used props to pass user data from UserList component to UserCard component.
Rendered multiple cards dynamically using `map()` and added CSS styling for a clean UI.
